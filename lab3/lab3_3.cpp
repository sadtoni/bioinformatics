/*
show the minimum and maximum values over the 2 signals.
in addition, allow the user to set a threshold (like a filter)
that is able to take into consideration only the values above the threshold,
which should then be shown to the user on a second chart, as horizontal bars
(as in: the regions of the second chart, corresponding to values
that on the 1st chart are above the threshold, should just be filled with a solid color,
indicating to the user where to look). thus, the chunks of the signal that are above the threshold,
are shown as a horizontal bar over the signals. wherever the signal is below the threshold, the chart should show empty space.
